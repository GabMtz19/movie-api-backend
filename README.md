# Full Stack Development with Java Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB course project (freeCodeCamp)
## Backend

This project was created to learn about full-stack development, utilizing skills and software such as Java Spring Boot, React, and MongoDB. The React project provides the frontend, allowing the user to access the data the API returns from the backend on the Spring Boot project. The data is retrieved from a database in MongoDB, allowing the API to connect to the specific connection URL through the environment variables (file that is not uploaded to this repository for safety reasons).

Run the [MoviesApplication] file in order to start running the project. 

### NOTE:

In order for the project to work, you must create your own .env file, which should contain all the environment variables necessary for the project to connect to your own MongoDB project. You can obtain the necessary data to set up the MongoDB project from the IMDb movie database.
